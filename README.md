The first player who reaches 100 points wins. However, if the dice
shows one, you will lose your turn and the next player will play. For
this reason you must calculate when to stop and hold your result. When
the score of 100 points is reached, click on a new game to start
again.Total wins are displayed in the upper left and right corners.
